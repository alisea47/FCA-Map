Software: Java 1.7 or higher. 
Hardware: 16GB RAM or more. The CPU is not limited, but we still hope that the CPU in your computer is as efficient as possible, which can reduce a lot of time consumption.


Usage:
At present, we mainly provide the interface for IDE such as Elipse. If you install it, you can import this project directly.

a)unzip the files Lexical_Tools.7z and Ontologies.7z in the current directory.

b)run MatcherBridge1.java in the package edu.amss.fca.Method for matching tasks. In the main function, we provide whole paths of matching tasks. 

c)run StatisticResult.java in the package edu.amss.fca.Method to evaluate results.
